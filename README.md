# tmStreamer
A tool that can stream contents of the image editor [Texture Maker](http://texturemaker.com)
into a live render window.


The tool enabled me to create a live texture from within an emphasized image creation software and
render it in real time into my visualisation spplications via `GLSL`/`HLSL` fragment shaders. I used
this as a tool to create live visuals in Berlin's club scene in the year 2013.
